A Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is defined by Wikipedia as an Open Source web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents. It can be classified as a programming tool.   

A Jupyter Notebook document is a browser-based REPL containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media. Underneath the interface, a notebook is a JSON document, following a versioned schema, usually ending with the ".ipynb" extension. Developing tools such as Visual Studio Code (VSC), Azure Data Studio, Azure ML Studio, and others provide a way to create and execute Jupyter Notebooks either locally or remotely.   

As with every new technology or tool you’ll require to learn it and have certain skills in at least one of the many supported programming languages - hopefully Python. Therefore, to make the process less painful, and more fun, you can have some head start by leveraging some simple code snippets included within the Sentinel Notebook.   

Regardless, if you are a seasonal developer, or an expert, or simply a newbie, you can agree that having a library of existing piece of code that you can quickly import into your Notebook document, and use right out the box is a powerful feature. Almost all engineers and developers use code snippets (either from a library or simply form the internet) in their daily work.   

Code Snippets are convenient and saves times when performing the same task over and over. If you use snippets, you can significantly reduce time, organize many processes, and get a ready-made solution for many tasks. 

This concept applies to Jupyter Notebooks as well. When comes down to develop a notebook for Sentinel, you will need four fundamental pieces of code that allow the notebook to authenticate and connect to the data source stored on the workspace, load all the packages required to formulate and execute KQL queries against it, and setup the environment for the integration with Microsoft Security Center (mstic) Python packages (msticpy).
By typing the  keyword “Sentinel” you’ll be able to import the needed code for the above requirements.  

Use this notebook as a guide for your first custom Sentinel Notebook.
